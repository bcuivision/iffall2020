        <h1>Brian's Introductory Questions</h1>

        <p>
            1. My name is Brian Cui, and I'm a sophmore majoring 
            Studio Arts and Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. With my academic interests lying in arts and 
            computer science, it seems like a no-brainer for me to
            take this course, as it perfectly combines both fields.
        </p>

        <p>
            3. Although I have taken CS classes before, I have no 
            previous experience with HTML/CSS/JS.
        </p>

        <p>
            4. Through this course, I hope to gain foundational 
            insights in the field of UI/UX while learning the technical
            jargons of HTML/CSS/JS.
        </p>

        <p>
            5. I expect designing for screen to be more interactive
             from designing for paper.
        </p>

        <p>
            6. I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>
            exemplifies effective communication. Its design is simple 
            yet effective. Having the four essential icons on the left
            and suggested video contents covering the majority of the 
            screen real estate not only allows the user to easily 
            discover new contents, but also keeps the functionals 
            within reach.
        </p>

        <p>
            7. I think <a href="https://www.2-c.earth/">this case study
            </a> exemplifies effective communication, as it articulately
            expresses its narrative while being impactful.

        </p>

        <p>
            8. I think <a href="https://www.jingqi.work/"> this portfolio
            </a> works well, as it clearly highlights the artist's works 
            and experience without being tedious.
